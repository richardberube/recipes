**Prep Time:** 15 mins  | **Cook Time:** 10 hrs  | **Servings:** 32 

## Ingredients:
- [ ] **5** pounds Granny Smith apples, cored and cut into 1-inch pieces
- [ ] **1 ½** cups white sugar
- [ ] **½** cup brown sugar
- [ ] **1** teaspoon salt
- [ ] **2** teaspoons ground cinnamon
- [ ] **⅛** teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
- [ ] **½** teaspoon ground allspice
- [ ] **¼** cup apple cider vinegar
- [ ] **1** splash water

## Directions:
1. Place apple pieces into a large slow cooker. Add white sugar, brown sugar, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and vinegar. Add a splash of water and mix well.
2. Cover and cook on High until apples are starting to soften and release liquid, 1 to 2 hours. Reduce heat to Low and cook, uncovered, until all the apple flesh is dissolved, 5 to 6 hours. Stir occasionally.
3. Puree using an immersion blender until smooth. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until darkened and thick, about 4 hours more. Pass apple butter through a strainer if desired. Seal in a glass container and refrigerate until cool.

## Notes:
Any classic cooking apple should work in this recipe.
If you don't have a slow cooker you can certainly do it on top of the stove over low heat, as long as you use a nice thick-bottomed pot, and stir often. Another option would be to place the mixture in a large roasting pan, and cook it in a slow oven, stirring occasionally until dark and thick.
