- [ ] **200 g** sugar
- [ ] **200 g** wheat flour (Type 405)
- [ ] **50 g** cornstarch
- [ ] **50 g** cocoa powder
- [ ] **2 tsp** baking powder

**FOR THE FILLING:**
- [ ] **1 jar** sour cherries (drained weight 350 g)
- [ ] **2 tbsp** sugar
- [ ] **2 tbsp** cornstarch

**FOR THE CREAM:**
- [ ] **1 liter** chilled cream
- [ ] **5 packets** whipped cream stabilizer
- [ ] **1 tbsp** sugar

**ALSO:**
- [ ] **9 tbsp** cherry brandy (Kirschwasser)
- [ ] **100 g** dark chocolate shavings

## Directions:
1. Line a springform pan (Ã˜ 26 cm) with parchment paper. Preheat the oven to 180 degrees Celsius (160 degrees Celsius for convection). Separate the eggs, placing the egg whites in a mixing bowl. Beat the egg whites with the whisk attachments of a hand mixer until they are semi-stiff. Gradually add the sugar in small portions while continuing to beat.
2. Continue beating until a glossy meringue forms. Gently fold in the egg yolks. In a separate bowl, mix and sift the flour, cornstarch, cocoa powder, and baking powder. Gradually and carefully fold the dry mixture into the egg mixture in three portions. Make sure to keep the batter airy and light.
3. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake in the preheated oven for approximately 30 minutes. After baking, let it cool on a wire rack, then release the sides of the springform pan using a knife. For the filling, drain the cherries, reserving the juice. Set aside 16 cherries for decoration.
4. Bring two-thirds of the cherry juice to a boil in a saucepan. In the remaining one-third of the juice, mix the sugar and cornstarch until smooth and free of lumps. Once the juice in the saucepan is boiling, stir in the sugar and cornstarch mixture, making sure to combine everything well. Gently stir in the cherries. Allow the filling to cool briefly.
5. Slice the cooled sponge cake horizontally into three layers, creating three cake bases. Drizzle each cake layer with cherry brandy. Spread the filling evenly over the first cake layer, leaving a 1 cm border around the edges. Place a cake ring around the base.
6. Pour the chilled cream into a bowl and beat it on low speed. As the cream starts to thicken, gradually add the whipped cream stabilizer and sugar. Continue beating on low speed until the cream reaches a stiff consistency. Spread a portion of the whipped cream over the cherries and smooth it out. Place the second cake layer on top and gently press it down.
7. Spread half of the remaining whipped cream onto the cake layer and smooth it out. Place the third cake layer on top and press it firmly. Chill the cake for 1 hour. Set aside a piping bag fitted with a star tip and fill it with approximately 5 tablespoons of the whipped cream.
8. Carefully remove the cake ring upwards. Frost the entire cake with the remaining whipped cream, using a palette knife to smooth it out. Gently press the chocolate shavings onto the outer edge of the cake, using your hands. Set aside 1 tablespoon of chocolate shavings for later use.
9. Pipe 16 dollops of whipped cream onto the cake and decorate each dollop with a cherry. Scatter the remaining chocolate shavings in the center of the cake. Keep the cake refrigerated until ready to serve. The cake yields approximately 16 slices.
