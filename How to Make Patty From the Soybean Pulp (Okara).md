## Ingredients:
- [ ] **1 lb (~453g)** soybean pulp
- [ ] **1 small** carrot finely diced
- [ ] **2 stalks** green onion finely chopped
- [ ] **¾ cup (94g)** all-purpose flour or use gluten-free flour
- [ ] **2 tablespoons** cornstarch
- [ ] **1** nori sheet cut into strips
- [ ] **1½ teaspoon** salt
- [ ] **¼ teaspoon** mushrooms seasoning
- [ ] dash of pepper
- [ ] **½ cup** of water plus more if needed
- [ ] cooking oil
- [ ] toasted sesame seeds as garnish
- [ ] Sauce
- [ ] Sweet Thai chile sauce
- [ ] a handful of chopped cilantro
- [ ] a squeeze of lime juice

## Directions:
1. Make the patties. Combine the soybean pulp, carrot, chopped green onion, all-purpose flour, cornstarch, and the seasoning in a large mixing bowl. Mix with your hand until well combined.
2. Gradually add the water to create a slightly wet paste. Then, add nori strips and mix until incorporated. Divide into 8 to 10 equal portions.
3. Shape the patties. Gently press each portion into a disk, about 4-inch wide and 1-cm thick.
4. Cook the patties. Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan. Cook in batches if needed, gently slide the patties into the pan, slightly apart. Flatten each patty slightly with the back of your palm.
5. Cover the pan with a lid and turn down the heat but maintain a light sizzle. Pan-fry for about 2 to 3 minutes or until golden brown.
6. Uncover, slide a spatula under the patty, and flip. If the patty is undercooked, cook for another minute. Once flipped, cover and cook the other side for another 2 to 3 minutes. Tip: For a more golden brown outer layer, pan-fry each side for another minute or so, uncovered.
7. While the patties are cooking, make the sauce. Whisk together 3 tablespoons of sweet Thai chile sauce, chopped cilantro, and lime juice in a bowl until well combined.
8. When the patties are ready, transfer to a plate, sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds, and serve warm or at room temperature with the prepared sauce.
