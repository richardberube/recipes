#Micro-Pousse #Sprouts

## Directions:
1. Soak. Using a tray with drainage holes, rinse enough seed to cover the bottom of the tray. Soak the seed for 4-12 hours. Drain, rinse and drain holding at an angle to remove excess water. Spread the seed evenly on the bottom of the tray and cover with a lid top and bottom or put in plastic bag. Place in a dark area such as a pantry. (Bean shoots will be bitter if grown in the light.)
2. TIP: If you want very tall, straight bean shoots you can place a weight on top of the tray, such as an lid with a bag of seed or heavy jar.
3. Rinse. Rinse with water twice a day, using either a gentle flow from a tap or dipping in a sink. Drain.
4. TIP: Bean shoots love water and can be rinsed 3 or more times a day if you have the time.
5. Harvest!
6. Typically, bean shoots are harvested at 6-7 days. Harvest before the next expected rinse so the shoots are dry.
