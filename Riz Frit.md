## Ingredients:
- [ ] **2 tbsp** Chinese light soy sauce
- [ ] **2 tbsp** Mirin
- [ ] **1 tsp** white sugar
- [ ] **2 tbsp** vegetable oil
- [ ] **4** garlic cloves, roughly chopped
- [ ] **1** small onion, diced
- [ ] **200g (7oz)** diced cooked chicken
- [ ] **1 cup** frozen mixed vegetables
- [ ] **3 eggs**, lightly whisked
- [ ] **3 cups (450g/1lb)** cooked jasmine or long grain rice (preferably made the day before)
- [ ] **1 tsp** sea salt
- [ ] **¼ cup** finely sliced spring onion (scallions)
- [ ] **1 tbsp** sesame oil
- [ ] **¼ tsp** ground white pepper

## Directions:
1. Make the fried rice stir-fry sauce by mixing the soy sauce, mirin and sugar.
2. Prepare, measure and chop all ingredients before cooking.
3. Heat the vegetable oil in a wok or large frying pan over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until just starting to turn golden. Add the onion and stir-fry for another 30 seconds or until the onion is just softened. Add the char siu pork  and the vegetables and stir-fry for another 30 seconds until warmed through.
4. Push all the ingredients over to one side of the pan or wok. Tilt the pan so that the oil slides into the empty side. Pour the eggs into the oil. Use a spatula to spread the egg out so it cooks evenly. Once the egg is set, break it up and mix with other ingredients. Add the rice and break up and incorporate the rice with the other ingredients. Add the soy sauce mixture and stir-fry until well combined. Toss through the sea salt and spring onion. Turn the heat off and toss through the sesame oil and white pepper. Serve warm.
