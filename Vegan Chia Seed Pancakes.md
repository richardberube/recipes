**Prep Time:** 10 mins  | **Cook Time:** 10 mins  | **Servings: Yield:** 10 pancakes 

## Ingredients:
- [ ] **1 1/2 cups** all-purpose flour (180 g)
- [ ] **1 tbsp** baking powder
- [ ] **1/2 tsp** sea salt
- [ ] **3 tbsp** chia seeds (33 g)
- [ ] **3 tbsp** maple syrup (45 mL)
- [ ] **1 1/2 cup** almond milk (354 mL)
- [ ] **1 tsp** apple cider vinegar (5 mL)
- [ ] **1 tsp** cinnamon, optional
- [ ] **1 tsp** vanilla extract, optional

## Directions:
1. Mix together all the dry ingredients (flour, baking powder, salt, chia seeds, cinnamon if using) in a medium mixing bowl. Use a fork or whisk to help break up any clumps of flour and distribute the chia seeds, baking powder and salt.
2. In a separate bowl, mix together the wet ingredients (milk, maple syrup, vinegar, vanilla if using).
3. Add the wet ingredients to the bowl with the dry ingredients and whisk or stir until all of the flour is incorporated but the batter is still a bit lumpy. Avoid over mixing.
4. Let the batter rest for 5-10 minutes while you heat a nonstick skillet, griddle or crepe pan over medium heat. If needed, add a light coating of oil or nonstick cooking spray to the pan.
5. Once the pan is hot, scoop approximately 1/4 cup portions of the batter into the pan.
6. Let each pancake cook until the edges appear dry, firm and golden brown and small bubbles are appearing in the batter, about 4-5 minutes. Flip them and cook for another 30-60 seconds until cooked through and browned on both sides.
7. Repeat until you’ve used all the batter. You should get approximately 10 pancakes or enough to serve 3-4 people.
8. Serve right away with your favourite pancakes toppings like fresh fruit and maple syrup.
